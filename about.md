#About Me
How be? I'm Toby Foord. I am an IT developer based in Truro, Cornwall (for my sins).

I have been gainfully employed in the world of web development, intranet systems and consumer facing web applications for 5 years. 

##Web Development

Starting out I entered the field at an engineering firm hoping to make use of my recently completed Electronic Engineering Bachelors from Exeter University. Conversely the board at the interview were far more interested in my handful of Php and mySQL knowledge. Followed were my first steps into an IT department.

Within a few short months I had been tasked with the migration and extension of a fairly archaic classic asp intranet. A fantastic, self managed role, wherein I would be provided the most scant, brief, fag-packet ideas and be left to realisation, development, testing, implementation and training. I trully was the jack of all trades!





##Fact

In this time I have drunk approvimately 6000 cups of tea and 600 cups of coffee; coffee being generally reserved for those "oh sh*t" days, which, worryingly, would seem to be about 1 in 10 :/
