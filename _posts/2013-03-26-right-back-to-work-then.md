A month into fatherhood and I figure it's about time to get back into the website.

Firstly, I've shifted across the idodev.co.uk domain to github pages. A super easy process of adding a file to the repo named `CNAME` containing the domain name. After that its just a case of modifying the DNS A Record to point at github's IP address. If you wan't to find out more just hop over to the help files [here][githubdnshelp]

Going back on what I've said previously I did feel a little at a loss with my writing workflow. Initially I have been using iA Writer to write the articles, and have held a local copy of the git repository on dropbox so as I can write from both my mac and my iPhone (amazing how many things come to mnd when on the move!). The big gripe is when I come to publish. At this point I still needed a machine with access to my dropbox (not a a massive challenge) and more akwardly to have Git installed (a real *pita*) to push up my changes.


I admit the first thing that came to mind was "Aha! A project!", some sketches and doodles later it seemed my use case was just too obscure, a service to push a git repo hosted on dropbox to github! By chance I spotted reference to [prose.io][prose] on an [article][scribu] by **Silviu-Cristian BurcÄƒ**
