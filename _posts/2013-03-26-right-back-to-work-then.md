A month into fatherhood and I figure it's about time to get back into the website.

Firstly, I've shifted across the idodev.co.uk domain to github pages. A super easy process of adding a file to the repo named `CNAME` containing the domain name. After that its just a case of modifying the DNS A Record to point at github's IP address. If you wan't to find out more just hop over to the help files [here][githubdnshelp]

Going back on what I've said previously I did feel a little at a loss with my writing workflow. Initially I have been using iA Writer to write the articles, and have held a local copy of the git repository on dropbox so as I can write from both my mac and my iPhone (amazing how many things come to mnd when on the move!). However, to publish I still needed a machine with access to my dropbox and more akwardly git installed.
