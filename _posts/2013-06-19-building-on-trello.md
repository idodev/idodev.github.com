In recent months I have found myself becoming increasingly reliant on [trello](http://www.trello.com) for organising my workflow, both long and short term. As a project management tool it is very flexible, intuitive and tactile - a far cry from most of the competition!

the basic premise in its operation are its boards that contain lists that contain cards. These cards are your work items, they can be popultated with notes, checklists, attachments, due dates and more.


As is always the way, i found a limitation in its implementation
